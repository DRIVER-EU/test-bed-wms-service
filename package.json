  "description": "A Mapnik-based WMS service that watches a folder with GeoJSON files and publishes them as WMS. Each GeoJSON file that is served needs to have a Mapnik XML configuration, as can be seen in the styles folder. Besides support for WMS v1.1.1, it also offers support for accessing files as tile layer, e.g. http://HOST:PORT/LAYERNAMES/zoom/x/y.png",
